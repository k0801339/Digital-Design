1. There are three folders, part1, part2 and part3
	Please write question 1 in part1, question 2 in part2, question 3 in part3
	that is,
	part1/hw5_1_test.v	:	the testbench of question1
	part1/hw5_1.v		:	the design of question1
	part1/decoder.v		:	the 3:8 decoder
	part1/Makefile		:	use this file to run simulation

	part2/hw5_2_test.v	:	the testbench of question2
	part2/hw5_2.v		:	the design of question2
	part2/Makefile		:	use this file to run simulation

	part3/hw5_3_test.v	:	the testbench of question3
	part3/hw5_3.v		:	the design of question3
	(part3/hw5_2.v)		:	the design of question2 (Makefile will copy from part2)
	part3/Makefile		:	use this file to run simulation

	NOTE: please DO NOT change the port and module name

2. Run:
	in each folder, use Makefile to run simulation:
	$make
	and you can use Makefile to clear all temporary files
	$make clean

	NOTE: please finish part2 before you start part3
		The Makefile will copy the file part2/hw5_2.v to part3/ before part3 begin to run simulation
